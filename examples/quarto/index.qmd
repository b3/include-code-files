With the include-code-files filter, you can include code snippets directly from a file using the `include` attribute.

```{.python include="_snippets/hello_world.py"}
```

You can combine this with other quarto attributes like `filename` or `code-line-numbers`:

```{.python include="_snippets/hello_world.py" filename="hello_world.py" code-line-numbers="true"}
```
